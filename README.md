## Blockchain-based ScubaChain

### Project Description

This project focuses on developing a Blockchain-based system to securely manage scuba diving certifications, dive logs, and other related processes. The system will involve three primary personas: diver, divemaster, and dive center. Each persona will have a unique role within the system, utilizing digitally signed certifications to validate skills, certifications, and dive logs. The system will consist of two components: a web-based platform (web interface): Used by the dive centers and divemasters to verify certifications and log dives on the blockchain and a mobile Application: Used by divers to register, request dives, and review dive logs.
